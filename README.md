# Degenerate Mod

NOTE :: REPENTANCE ONLY! OBVIOUS NSFW WARNING!

Please check out the GITHUB wiki I've provided and follow the twitter (@ProfDisappoint) for occasional updates

I've tried to make it so the mod doesn't interfere with anything so pack merges wouldn't have to be necessary. If you do want to merge it though, I've made it decently 
easy to do so with most of the things in their own seperate files instead of a giant main.lua clump. Even then, good luck reading my damn code.

Download Guide :
1) Top Right Code button > Download ZIP

OR ALTERNATIVELY

1) Right side Releases > Download Source Code on Latest Release
2) Extract ZIP into "steamapps\common\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\mods"

Currently at a very early stage, things are not finished. At all. It barely works and the code is cursed.
